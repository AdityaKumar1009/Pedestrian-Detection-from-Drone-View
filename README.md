**Pedestrian and Vehicle Detection for Drone Surveillance**

This project uses computer vision and deep learning to detect pedestrians and vehicles in real-time drone footage.

Developed an advanced computer vision model for drones to enhance surveillance and public safety capabilities.
Utilized advanced deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to develop and optimize models for accurate object detection 
and tracking.
Employed state-of-the-art techniques such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for object detection and 
utilized TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development
and training.
